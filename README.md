The rapid expansion of interconnected systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly 
increased the complexity and frequency of cyber-attacks, demanding innovative solutions for 
effective detection and prevention. This study introduces a robust intrusion detection framework that 
combines deep learning and advanced machine learning algorithms to address these challenges. 
The system utilizes autoencoders for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, optimizing the 
processing of complex network traffic while retaining critical patterns indicative of malicious 
activity. Two state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, XGBoost and LightGBM, are employed 
independently to classify network anomalies, offering insights into their respective strengths in 
detecting cyber threats. Evaluated using the NSL-KDD dataset, the framework emphasizes 
scalability, efficiency, and adaptability, demonstrating its potential to handle large-scale and high-
dimensional data. This approach showcases the effectiveness of integrating deep learning with 
machine learning in developing intelligent, real-time cybersecurity solutions.
